Don't forget to check the water levels regularly and add nutrients once a week.\r\n\r\n###Plant Controller Features:\r\n\r\n  * For use with either Ebb &amp; Flow systems, Bubbler (DWC) systems, NFT systems, Wicking systems, and Misting systems (aeroponics), \r\n  * Arduino Based - Written for UNO, easily ported to Mega. NOT AVAILABLE FOR NANO\r\n  * Rotary Encoder driven GUI\r\n  * Interactive Menu System\r\n  * Independent Manual ON, Off Auto settings for each Timer/Output\r\n  * Real-Time Alert for Lights and Pump/Drain operation on Home Screen\r\n  * Power Supply Switching Schematic includes: \r\n    * 2 = 110VAC outputs for Lights\r\n    * FOR EBB & FLOW SYSTEM:\r\n      * 1 = 110VAC Output for Pump \r\n      * 1 = 110VAC Output for Drain Valve (N/O operation)\r\n    * FOR ALL OTHER SYSTEMS:\r\n      * 2 = 110VAC Outputs for Aeration/H2O Pumps\r\n    \r\n    \r\n###Pump/Drain Timer Characteristics: \r\n\r\n  * User selectable \r\n  * Adjustable ON time up to 60 Minutes\r\n  * Off time adjustable between hours and minutes\r\n    * Off Hours adjustable up to 24\r\n    * Off Minutes adjustable up to 60\r\n  * Pump Timer executes \"Auto ON\" as soon as Auto is turned on (handy for priming system on first use)\r\n\r\n###Light Timer Characteristics:\r\n\r\n  * On Time can be set any time between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM\r\n  * Off Time can be set any time between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM\r\n  * Controls two 110VAC Light Outputs using included Power Supply Switching Schematic\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nProject designed, written, compiled, de-bugged, and published by Chris Bean (@TheOGMr-Bean) on 11/7/2016.\r\nAny part of this work may not be copied or redistrubuted for profit or financial gain without express permission.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nChris Bean\r\nBeansAutoRepair@Gmail.com",
